### Project Title: NBA Player Position Classification üèÄ

#### Overview:
In this project, we aim to classify NBA players into five positions on the basketball court: SG (shooting guard), PG (point guard), SF (small forward), PF (power forward), and C (center). We will use NBA player statistics from the regular season to train a classification model.

#### Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Basketball Reference ([NBA 2023 Regular Season Player Stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2023_per_game.html)). The data is provided in a CSV file named "nba_stats.csv".

#### Tasks:
1. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    - Utilize various classification methods, including Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, and Neural Networks, on the dataset.
    - Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering as necessary.
    - Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% validation sets (using `random_state=0`).
    - Print out the training and validation set accuracy of each model.
    - Display the confusion matrix for both training and validation sets.

2. **Testing on Dummy Test Set:**
    - Apply the trained models to a dummy test set provided in the file "dummy_test.csv".
    - Print the accuracy and confusion matrix for each model on the dummy test set.

3. **Cross-Validation:**
    - Use 10-fold stratified cross-validation with each classification method.
    - Print out the accuracy of each fold for every model.
    - Calculate and print the average accuracy across all folds for each model.

#### Implementation Details:
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn
- Model Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
- Classification Methods: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, Neural Networks
- Model Tuning: Hyperparameter tuning (if applicable)

#### Files:
1. `nba_stats.csv`: Contains NBA player statistics for the regular season.
2. `dummy_test.csv`: Example test set for evaluating the trained models.
3. `nba_position_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code implementation for the tasks.
4. `README.md`: Markdown file providing an overview of the project, tasks, implementation details, and files used.

#### Usage:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/devarshvora/nba-position-classification.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd nba-position-classification`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `nba_position_classification.ipynb` to execute the code and perform tasks.
4. View the results, including accuracy, confusion matrices, and model evaluation metrics for each classification method.
